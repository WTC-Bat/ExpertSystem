### TODO:
	- NEGATION
		- Negation for 'inference' (test)
			- Somewhat, but a compounded inference has a bit of
				issues. See comment in ./tests/test_neg_inf
		- NEGATION FOR 'requirement'
	- CONFLICTS
	- Check for any other possible "UNDETERMINED" states
	- More tests. Parentheses, XOR, more negation tests,
		more complex patterns
